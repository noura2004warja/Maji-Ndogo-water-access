## Overview

Access to clean and reliable water is a fundamental human right, yet many communities still struggle with shortages, contamination, and infrastructure challenges. **Maji Ndogo Water Access** is a database that tracks and analyzes water access and quality across different regions. This project supports efforts to improve water infrastructure, monitor pollution, and ensure sustainable access for communities in need.

## Purpose

The primary goal of this database is to provide **comprehensive and actionable insights** into water service accessibility, quality, and infrastructure performance. By leveraging this data, we aim to:

- **Identify regions** in urgent need of water infrastructure improvements.
- **Monitor water quality** trends over time.
- **Evaluate the workload** and efficiency of field employees.
- **Track pollution levels** in water sources.
- **Support data-driven decision-making** for policymakers and organizations working on water accessibility.

## Database Structure

The database `md_water_services` contains over **60,000 records** spanning **43 data fields** across multiple tables. Below is a breakdown of the key components:

 - `Employee`: Stores details of field employees responsible for water monitoring and data collection, including their contact information and job roles.
 - `Global Water Access`: Provides a high-level overview of water access statistics, segmented by country, region, and population distribution.
 - `Location`: Captures surveyed locations, categorized by geographical data and type of water service point.
 - `Visits`: Records field visits to water sources, tracking the frequency, conditions, and wait times at each location.
 - `Water Quality`: Logs water quality assessments based on subjective scores and field visit data.
 - `Water Source`: Maintains details about different water sources, including the number of people they serve.

 - `Well Pollution`: Tracks pollution test results, recording contamination levels and potential risks to water safety.

## How This Data Can Be Used

The `md_water_services` database is a powerful tool for:

- **Pinpointing high-risk areas** where urgent action is needed.
- **Tracking changes in water quality** over time.
- **Optimizing employee deployment** to ensure efficient monitoring.
- **Assessing pollution risks** and identifying trends in contamination.
- **Helping policymakers and NGOs** develop targeted water accessibility programs.
